    "filename_grouping": "You are a file organization expert. Below is a JSON list of filenames suggested by another AI. Your task is to group filenames that refer to the same subject or event, even if the wording is slightly different (e.g., 'cat_on_sofa' and 'sofa_with_cat' should be grouped). For each group, create a single, uniform, descriptive base name. Respond ONLY with a JSON object where each key is the uniform base name, and the value is a list of the original filenames belonging to that group. If a filename is unique, it should be in its own group.\n\nExample Input:\n[\"cat_on_sofa.jpg\", \"dog_in_park.jpg\", \"sofa_with_cat.jpg\"]\n\nExample Output:\n{\n  \"cat_on_sofa\": [\"cat_on_sofa.jpg\", \"sofa_with_cat.jpg\"],\n  \"dog_in_park\": [\"dog_in_park.jpg\"]\n}\n\nNow, process the following list:\n{filename_list_json}"
